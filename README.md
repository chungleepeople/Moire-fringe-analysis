## What is moire fringe ?
```
In the semiconductor development process, wafer alignment is the great significance of the technology.

During the wafer bonding or photolithography process, poor alignment causes the wafer to have defective products or even circuit discontinuities. 

Thus, the alignment of the wafers before photolithography is important. 

The Moir√© fringes can be used for nano-level detection, which can be directly detected by the optical system through the magnification characteristics of the fringes without additional assistances.
